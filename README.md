The application was designed to recognize and translate Latvian deaf sign language gestures into text with high accuracy. It involved several key stages:

Research:

Explored available technologies and methods for sign language translation.
Analyzed the structure and nuances of Latvian Sign Language (LSL).
Development:

Reviewed and adapted existing algorithms and techniques to meet the specific requirements of Latvian gestures.
Trained models using both static and dynamic gesture datasets, achieving exceptional accuracy rates.
Dynamic Gesture Recognition:

Developed two algorithms for dynamic gesture detection:
Hand Coordinate Analysis: Tracks the "x" and "y" coordinates of the user's hand to interpret gestures.
Index Finger Tracking: Tracks the fingertip to simulate drawing on the screen, enabling precise gesture recognition.
Application Development:

Created a user-friendly application that converts recognized gestures into Latvian text.
Evaluated the software's functionality and user experience for optimal performance.
